2. Monte Carlo - rozk³ad temperatury w 2-D. (Quinn, zad. 10.9)
OPIS:
10.9 Implement a parallel program solving the steady-state temperature
problem described in Section 10.5.2. Assume the square plate has been
discretized into a 20 x 20 grid of smaller squares. Assume the
temperature on three sides of the plate is 0" and the temperature on the
fourth side is 100'. Compute the temperature at the middle of the plate
to three digits of precision.
